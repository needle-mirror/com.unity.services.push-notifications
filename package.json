When either is installed:\n  - A new `PushSDKDependencies.xml` file is generated for them to use.\n  - `InsertPushNotificationDependenciesIntoGradleScript` will not run to prevent duplication from gradle.\n- Fixed errors appearing in the Editor Play Mode due to platform specific classes instantiating."
